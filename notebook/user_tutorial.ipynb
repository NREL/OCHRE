    "flexible devices---including HVAC equipment, water heaters, electric vehicles,\n",
    "solar PV, and batteries---and the thermal and electrical interactions between\n",
    "them. OCHRE has been used to generate diverse and high-resolution load\n",

    "and occupant comfort, and assess grid reliability and resilience through\n",
    "building-to-grid co-simulation.\n",
