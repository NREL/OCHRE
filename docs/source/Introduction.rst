OCHRE Overview
--------------

OCHRE\ |tm| is a Python-based building energy modeling (BEM) tool designed to
model flexible loads in residential buildings. OCHRE includes detailed models
and controls for flexible devices including HVAC equipment, water heaters,
electric vehicles, solar PV, and batteries. It is designed to run in
co-simulation with custom controllers, aggregators, and grid models. OCHRE
integrates with `OS-HPXML
<https://openstudio-hpxml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__, and any
OS-HPXML integrated workflow can be used to generate OCHRE input files.

.. |tm| unicode:: U+2122

More information about OCHRE is available on `NREL's
website <https://www.nrel.gov/grid/ochre.html>`__ and on
`Github <https://github.com/NREL/OCHRE>`__.

Installation
------------

For a stand-alone installation, OCHRE can be installed using ``pip``
from the command line:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install ochre-nrel

Alternatively, you can install a specific branch, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install git+https://github.com/NREL/OCHRE@dev

To embed OCHRE in a co-simulation using a conda environment, create an
``environment.yml`` file in the co-simulation project and include the
following lines:

.. code-block:: python

    dependencies:
     - pip:
       - ochre-nrel

Usage
-----

OCHRE can be used to simulate a residential dwelling or an individual
piece of equipment. In either case, a python object is instantiated and
then simulated. A set of input parameters must be defined.

Below is a simple example to simulate a dwelling:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import datetime as dt
    from ochre import Dwelling
    from ochre.utils import default_input_path # for using sample files

    house = Dwelling(
        start_time=dt.datetime(2018, 5, 1, 0, 0),
        time_res=dt.timedelta(minutes=10),
        duration=dt.timedelta(days=3),
        hpxml_file =os.path.join(default_input_path, 'Input Files','sample_resstock_properties.xml'),
        schedule_input_file=os.path.join(default_input_path, 'Input Files','sample_resstock_schedule.csv'),
        weather_file=os.path.join(default_input_path, 'Weather','USA_CO_Denver.Intl.AP.725650_TMY3.epw'),
        verbosity=3,
    )

    df, metrics, hourly = house.simulate()

This will return 3 variables:

- ``df``: a Pandas DataFrame with 10 minute resolution

- ``metrics``: a dictionary of energy metrics

- ``hourly``: a Pandas DataFrame with 1 hour resolution (``verbosity >= 3`` only)

OCHRE can also be used to model a specific piece of equipment so long as
the boundary conditions are appropriately defined. For example, a water
heater could be simulated alone so long as draw profile, ambient air
temperature, and mains temperature are defined.

For more examples, see the following python scripts in the ``bin``
folder:

- Run a single dwelling: `run_dwelling
  <https://github.com/NREL/OCHRE/blob/main/bin/run_dwelling.py>`__

- Run a single piece of equipment: `run_equipment
  <https://github.com/NREL/OCHRE/blob/main/bin/run_equipment.py>`__

- Run a dwelling with an external controller: `run_external_control
  <https://github.com/NREL/OCHRE/blob/main/bin/run_external_control.py>`__

- Run multiple dwellings: `run_multiple
  <https://github.com/NREL/OCHRE/blob/main/bin/run_multiple.py>`__

- Run a fleet of equipment: `run_fleet
  <https://github.com/NREL/OCHRE/blob/main/bin/run_fleet.py>`__
